<h2>CGO-4 Attendees' Travel Guide to New York</h2>
<p>
New York City is one of the world's most famous cities, and among the
older cities in North America.  Each city block is packed with
restaurants, shops, and the city itself has a number of interesting
attractions including the Broadway Theatre District, Radio City Music
Hall, Rockefeller Center, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island
amongst many others.  Keep an eye on this page for information about
travel to New York, restaurants around the conference venue, and
attractions that will be of interest to attendees.
</p>
<p>
In this guide you will find information about local attractions and a
map of the conference venue conference hotel, and other points of
interest.  We recommend that you start with the map to see where
everything is located.  This will help you plan your trip.
</p>

<h3>CGO Conference Venues</h3>
<p>
There are three main locations of activities for CGO:
<ol>
<li> Columbia University.  Columbia fills a rectangle roughly between
Riverside Drive and Morningside Park east-west, and from 110th Street
to 122nd Street north-south.  It is primarily served by the 116th
street stop of the #1 Subway line, which is a local stop.  For
WORKSHOPS, on Sunday 26 March, we will be using the Schapiro Center
and classrooms in the computer science department, in the northeast
corner of campus.  For the MAIN CONFERENCE, from Monday-Wednesday,
27-29 March, we will be using the Davis Auditorium, in the
Schapiro Center, in the middle of the North side of campus.
</li>
<li> The On-the-Ave and Lucerne Hotels.  These hotels are located on the
Upper West Side, near the 79th street #1 Subway stop (also a local stop; the
express stops at 72nd street).  The On-the-Ave is on the south side of 77th
street, just east of Broadway; the Lucerne is at the northwest corner of
79th Street and Amsterdam avenue, one block east of Broadway. 
</li>
<li> The Times Square Area.  The Google reception and business meeting on
Monday night, and the Spamalot excursion on Tuesday night, will be in the
Times Square area.  Google New York is located at 1440 Broadway, with an
entrance between 41st and 40th Streets.  Spamalot is at the Shubert Theater,
at 225 West 44th Street, between Broadway and 8th Avenues.  
</li>
</ol>
See the "Getting Around Manhattan" section below for information on how
to get from one venue to the other.
</p>
<p>
The conference hotels, the On-the-Ave and the Lucerne, as well as the
conference venue, Columbia University, are all located on the
Upper-west side of Manhattan.  Other Conference events are in
mid-town.  The map below, shows the conference venue, hotels, and
various points of interest relative to the venue.  You can use the map
to plan your trip, book alternate hotels close to the Conference
venue, etc.

<h3>Airport Information</h3> 
<p>
New York City is served by 3 major international airports, JFK
International Airport (JFK), Newark-Liberty International Airport
(EWR), and LaGuardia International Airport (LGA).  To get from the
airports to CGO, see the instructions below.  Recall that the
conference hotels and venue are all on the Upper West side.  All the
Mass-transit instructions will place you in a major transit hub in New
York City.  See the rail directions below to determine how to get to
the Conference Venue from those transit hubs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
From Newark Airport (EWR): A taxi to the Upper West side will cost
about $70, including tolls and tip.  Texis operate on a flat-rate
system; the taxi dispatcher will hand you a yellow rate card and
indicate what your base flat-rate fare, before tolls and tip will be.
Note that there are three terminals (A, B, and C) at Newark aiprort
and there are sometimes very long taxi lines at one terminal but not
at another.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.njtransit.com">New Jersey Transit</a> also
operates an airtrain from the Newark Airport station with service into
New York Penn Station.  The monorail to the Newark Airport train
station is free; tickets from there to NY Penn Station are about $14
one-way.  To get to Penn Station from the Newark Airport station, hop
on a northbound <a
href="http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/rail/r0070.pdf">Northeast Corridor
NJ Transit train</a> to New York Penn Station (the end of the line on
northbound trains).  From here you can catch the subway to the hotel
and conference venue (see directions below).  Travel time is
approximately an hour.  
</p>
<p>
Coach buses, under the Olympia Trails line, operates buses from Newark
airport to Grand Central terminal and the Port Authority Bus Terminal; a
one-way ticket is $13.  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
From Kennedy Airport (JFK): A taxi to the Upper West Side will cost
between $60 and $70.  Taxis operate on a flat-rate system; the taxi
dispatcher will hand you a yellow rate card and indicate what your
base flat-rate fare, before tolls and tip, will be.
</p>
<p>
There are also very good mass transit options: the "AirTrain" operates
on the MetroCard system, and for $5 will get you either to the A
subway line (which then will take about a 45-minute ride into
Manhattan for about $2) or to the Jamaica station of the <a
href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/lirr/">Long Island Rail Road</a>, where
trains depart frequently to New York Penn Station (taking about 30
minutes and costing less than $10).
</p>
<p>
Bus service from JFK to Grand Central Terminal, New York Penn Station,
and the Port Authority Bus Terminal (all in Midtown) are about $12 one-way.
</p>
<p>Be sure to check for flights from discount carriers such as
JetBlue, as they have many inexpensive flights from many cities to
JFK and are not listed by many travel agents/services.
</p> 
<li>
<p>
From LaGuardia (LGA): The best option is to take
a taxi, which should cost around $30 including tip and the Triboro
bridge toll.  Buses exist, but aren't recommended.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Beware that if you are taking the train and subway through the city,
especially during rush hour, keep luggage to a minimum.  It will be
difficult to pull multiple large bags through the crowded train
stations.
</p>
<h3>Getting from Transit Hubs to the Conference/Hotels</h3> 
<p>
New York City has an excellent Subway system that can get you to most
of the city, including the conference venue and hotels.  The
Metropolitan transit authority has a Subway map for the city <a
href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/submap.htm">here</a>.  The #1
train line is marked in red on the map, the S-line as grey.
</p>
<ul>
<li>From Grand Central Terminal: take the "S" (Shuttle) subway line to
42nd street/Times Square, then transfer to the UPTOWN #1 Train.  Exit at
79th street for hotels, 116th street for Columbia University.</li>  

<li>From the Port Authority Bus Terminal: exit to the street, and walk one
block East to the #1 Subway line entrance.  Take an UPTOWN #1 train.  Exit
at 79th street for hotels, 116th street for Columbia University.  Note that
you may see signs for the #1 train within the Port Authority Bus Terminal,
however, reaching the #1 train from there requires much scurrying through
underground tunnels.  </li>

<li> From New York Penn Station.  The Uptown #1 train can be found at
the East end of the station.  Unfortunately, the station is lightless,
making it hard to tell which way is East, so ask directions or follow
the signs to the #1 Subway.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Around Manhattan</h3>
<p>
The two main effective means are subways and taxis.  A single subway
trip costs $2; the easiest way to pay for the subway is to buy a
MetroCard, which can either be time-based (flat fare for a day or
week) or money-based.  Taxis can be more cost-effective if you can
share a cab with others; the cab fare from the hotel to the
conference, or from the hotel to Times Square, should run less than
$10; a cab can fit four people.  The MetroCard works on buses as well,
but the bus lines are better saved for scenic views or crosstown
trips.
</p>
<h3>Going between Conference Events</h3>

<p>To get from the hotels to Columbia: go to the #1 Subway stop at
79th and Broadway, make sure to enter on the East side of Broadway to
get an UPTOWN train, and take the subway to 116th street.  Enter the
main Columbia campus through the big gates to the east of the subway
stop, then head diagonally northeast across campus to either the CS
department or Schapiro Center.  Or, go out to the street, raise your
hand to hail a cab, and tell the driver "Columbia University".  You
may need to add "116th street entrance on Broadway".  <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/map/schapiro_center.html">Here</a>
is a map of the Columbia Campus with Schapiro Center highlighted.  The
Subway stop is on the lower left-hand corner of the map (at Broadway
and 116th Street).  North is up on the map.
</p>
<p>
To get from Columbia to the hotels or activities: go to the #1 Subway
stop at 116th and Broadway, and take a DOWNTOWN train (you can enter on
either side of the street).  Exit at 79th street for hotels, or 42nd street
for activities.  
</p>
<p>
To return from activities: There are #1 Subway stops on Broadway at 50th
and 42nd streets.  Make sure to use an UPTOWN entrance.  Exit at 79th street
for hotels.
